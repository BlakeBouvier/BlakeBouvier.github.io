===Introduction===

My name is Blake Bouvier, I'm a Junior at UWT currently pursuing my bachelors of arts in computer science systems.
I love making things, whether it be small arduino projects, programs in java, games in gamemaker studio, or just model
kits. I

===About me===

I started undergraduate education at pierce college where I built my interest for computer programming, as well as
gathering prerequisites for moving to university. From there I started attending UWT and thats where I'm at currently
in my higher education journey. My career goals are centered around either game programming or enginneering software.
Recently I've been exploring engineering hobbies with microcontrollers and enjoying it so I'd like to explore a career
there, or possibly web development.

My most recent project has been a cosplay project where I'm using a ssyem of arduino microcontrollers to make a light
and sound system of a ghost busters proton pack. It's helped me learn so much about electric circuits, hardware components,
and exposed me to engineering software such as the arduino coding language.

While its a little less farther along, another project I've been working on is a pixel game in gamemaker studio. One of the 
main things that drew me to computer science was video game programming and it's remained an interest of mine for a long time. 
I'm really excited about is random level generation as thats something that always interested me in rogue-like games too and how
that cxonnects to computer logic.
